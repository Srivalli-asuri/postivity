    <center><p>Positivity is a state of mind we would all like to achieve, but it isn’t always easy. During a period of depression or loss, having a positive mindset can feel impossible. Many of us are also skeptical about positivity. We ask ourselves if it’s even possible to look on the bright side when there's so much negativity in the world.</p></center>
    <h2>How to Achieve Positivity in Challenging Times</h2>
     <ul>
        <li><h3>Be Mindful</h3></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Observe your thoughts</li>
            <p>Try not to label them as "good" or "bad" or get too invested. Watch them pass like traffic in your mind. Don't try to stop them or intervene</p>
            <li>Do one thing at a time</li>
            <p>When you are eating, for example, just eat. Don't watch TV or listen to music or work on your computer. Focus on the tastes and textures of the food in your mouth.</p>
            <li>Do nothing</li>
            <p>Every day, set aside 5-10 minutes to sit with yourself and just do nothing. No phone, no book, no TV, no music. Only you and your thoughts.</p>
        </ol>
        <li><h3>Practice Gratitude</h3></li>
        <p>Practicing gratitude is surprisingly simple. Find a time of day that suits you (the last thing at night works best) and write down three things for which you are grateful.</p>
        <li><h3>Journal</h3></li>
        <p>If you’re going through a challenging time in your life, starting a positivity journal could help you achieve a happier mindset. You can keep your gratitude lists here, jot down inspiring quotes and collect images that make you feel good.</p>
     </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Positive psychology is essentially about autonomy, self-acceptance, and personal growth. It is important to build positive emotional, psychological, and social resources in order to flourish. Growth mindsets and positive connections with others are key components to enhancing one's self-perception and -knowledge. A growth mindset is the belief that one's most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.</p>
